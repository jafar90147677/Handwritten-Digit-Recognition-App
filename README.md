# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-App
This project is a simple web application that recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) drawn by the user in the browser using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend canvas interface, it uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model trained on the MNIST dataset.
